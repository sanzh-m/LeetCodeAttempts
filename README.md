# LeetCodeAttempts
My attempts at LeetCode Problems (mostly medium and sometimes hard) <br />
These are certainly far from perfect, no always attempt to write original code <br />
In case the idea or piece of code is copied, it will be clearly indicated <br />
Any code copied is property of its respective owners, authors will be credited in such case <br />
Will try my best to commit weekly <br />

Update: found [NeetCode.io 150 list](https://neetcode.io/practice), decided to follow it for mor comprehensive and all round development
